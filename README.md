### VS Code Remote Development

If you are using [VSCode][1] you can work in a [development container][2].

Install the [Dev Containers extension][3] and check its
[system requirements][4]

1. Open the repository folder in VSCode
2. Choose "Dev Container: Open Folder in Container" via the command palette
3. The VS Code [integrated terminal][5] is now running in the container and can
   be used to run additional commands
